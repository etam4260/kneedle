# kneedle

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of kneedle is to provide an easy to use implementation of the kneedle 
algorithm developed at https://raghavan.usc.edu/papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf.
The main functionality is to detect inflection points, more commonly associated 
in continuous function, in discrete datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etam4260/kneedle")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(kneedle)
knee <- kneedle(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), c(0,1,2,3,40,100))
print(knee)
```
